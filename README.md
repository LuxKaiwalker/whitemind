# Whitemind

This is **Whitemind**, the Website UI built with Angular, providing a comprehensive guide to better understand and wield the power of Deep learning using our framework [Brainet](https://github.com/Neurologism/brainet)!
The Web interface combines the simple structure of the framework and is served from the backend server Backmind. Combining newest cutting edge technologies with simple and intuitive design, we aim to bring the power of deep learning to everyone.

# Tech Stack

The Website bases on different technologies to blend together and enhance to the optimal user experience.

### Angular

Angular is a powerful front-end framework used in the development of the web interface for our application. Its component-based architecture allows us to build reusable UI components, ensuring modularity and scalability. Angular's two-way data binding and reactive forms enable efficient handling of dynamic user inputs, crucial for features like context menus and form submissions. With its built-in support for routing and state management, Angular seamlessly integrates with other technologies in our tech stack, delivering a robust and responsive user experience across platforms.

### Typescript

TypeScript is used as the primary programming language for developing our web application, offering static typing to enhance code reliability and maintainability. By extending JavaScript, it allows us to catch errors early in the development process, leading to fewer bugs in production. Its strong typing also makes complex features like form validation and API integration more predictable and easier to manage, ensuring cleaner and more scalable code.

### Markdown

Markdown is used for writing documentation and content within the platform. Its simplicity allows developers and content creators to write formatted text quickly without needing to know complex HTML or CSS. Markdown ensures that documentation stays clean, readable, and easily exportable to various formats, making it an ideal choice for technical documentation and user guides within the project.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is employed for styling the web interface, providing a utility-first approach that allows for rapid UI development without writing custom CSS. Its predefined classes enable consistent, responsive designs across the application while keeping the CSS footprint minimal. By leveraging Tailwind, we can create highly customizable components with ease, resulting in a sleek and modern user interface.
